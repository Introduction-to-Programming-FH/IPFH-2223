Ignore any whitespace characters. For example, if the input is `\"hello world\"`, the function should return `{'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 3, 'o': 2, 'w': 1, 'r': 1, 'd': 1}`.\n",

    "Write a function `merge_dicts(dicts)` that takes a list of dictionaries as input and returns a single dictionary that merges all the dictionaries in the list. If there are any common keys among the dictionaries, the values should be combined into a list. For example, if the input is `[{1: 'a', 2: 'b'}, {2: 'c', 3: 'd'}, {4: 'e'}]`, the function should return `{1: 'a', 2: ['b', 'c'], 3: 'd', 4: 'e'}`.\n",

The keys of the dictionary should be the unique words in the sentence, and the values should be the corresponding counts. Ignore any punctuation and treat uppercase and lowercase letters as the same word. For example, if the input is `\"I love to code, and coding is fun!\"`, the function should return `{\"i\": 1, \"love\": 1, \"to\": 1, \"code\": 2, \"and\": 1, \"coding\": 1, \"is\": 1, \"fun\": 1}`.\n",
