The wish consists in checking whether an element prompted by the user is found inside of a list. If it is found, print \"Wish **number of the wish** granted, **item_name** is in the list, if it is not found print \"Wish **number of the wish** was wasted, **item_name** is not on the list\". Then, regardless if the wish was successful or not print \"You have **number of remaining wishes** more wishes\". Remember to increase wish_number after every iteration!
